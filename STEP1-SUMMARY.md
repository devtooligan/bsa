# Step 1: Extracting Raw Function Bodies for SSA Processing

## Changes Implemented

1. Added a new method `extract_function_body` to the `ASTParser` class that:
   - Takes a function definition node (either `ASTNode` or dictionary)
   - Extracts the statements list from the body node
   - Returns the raw statements list

2. Modified the `_process_contract_definition` method to:
   - Extract raw statements for each function using the new method
   - Store the extracted statements in the entrypoint dictionary as `body_raw`

3. Created a comprehensive test suite in `test_function_body.py` with tests for:
   - Extracting statements from a function body with statements
   - Handling empty function bodies
   - Handling functions with no body
   - Integration with the contract processing workflow

## Implementation Details

The implementation:
- Correctly handles different AST node types and structures
- Preserves the original AST structure for compatibility
- Adds the raw statements list as a new field without modifying existing logic
- Works with both `ASTNode` instances and raw dictionaries for flexibility

## Testing

All tests pass, including:
- Unit tests specifically for the function body extraction
- Integration tests with the rest of the codebase
- Existing tests that ensure backward compatibility

## Code Location

The main changes are in:
- `bsa/parser/ast_parser.py`: Added the `extract_function_body` method and modified the contract processing logic
- `bsa/tests/test_function_body.py`: Added tests for the new functionality

## Next Steps

The raw function bodies are now available for SSA (Static Single Assignment) processing, which will allow for more advanced static analysis of the Solidity code.
