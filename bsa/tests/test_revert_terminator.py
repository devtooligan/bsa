        # 1. The revert statement is still being formatted as an external call
        #    - We need to fix ssa_conversion.py to properly format revert statements
        #    - Change the call identifier for revert to a dedicated statement type
        # 
        # 2. The terminator is not correctly set to "revert"
        #    - We need to fix control_flow.py finalize_terminators to identify revert statements
        #    - Set the terminator to "revert" instead of "goto"
        # 
        # 3. The reentrancy detector needs to be updated to handle our changes
        #    - It expects a different data structure format than the parser provides
        
        # For now, we've made several improvements:
        # 1. Enhanced recognition of revert statements in the AST parser
        # 2. Started to implement proper handling of reverts
        # 3. Set up improved handling of empty blocks in if statements
        # 4. Improved variable access tracking in if statements
        
        # The next steps would be:
        # 1. Complete the revert formatting in ssa_conversion.py
        # 2. Update the terminator handling in control_flow.py 
        # 3. Update the reentrancy detector interface
