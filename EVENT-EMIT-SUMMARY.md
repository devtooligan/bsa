# Event Emit Tracking Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added support for tracking Solidity event emit statements in the Based Static Analyzer (BSA) tool's SSA output, which is crucial for analyzing ERC20 contracts and other contracts that use events to notify state changes.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Event Detection and Parsing
- Added support for parsing `EmitStatement` node types in the Solidity AST
- Implemented proper extraction of event names and arguments
- Added formatted emit statements in SSA output (e.g., `emit Transfer(msg.sender_0, recipient_0, amount_0)`)

### 2. Block Handling
- Modified `split_into_basic_blocks` to split blocks around emit statements
- Used special "EmitStatement" terminator type for emit blocks
- Ensured block terminators are preserved during SSA processing

### 3. Variable Access Tracking
- Implemented extraction of variables used in event arguments
- Updated accesses tracking to include all event arguments as "reads"
- Preserved access information when generating final SSA output

### 4. Testing
- Created comprehensive tests for event emit functionality
- Verified emit statement inclusion in SSA
- Validated proper block splitting around emits
- Confirmed accurate variable access tracking

## Key Files Modified
- `bsa/parser/ast_parser.py`: Added emit detection and processing logic
- `bsa/tests/test_emit_events.py`: Added tests for emit functionality

## Examples
In ERC20 contracts, the implementation now properly captures event emissions like:
```solidity
emit Transfer(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
```

The output SSA now includes:
```
emit Transfer(msg.sender_0, recipient_0, amount_0)
```

## Future Work
- Support for more complex event parameter expressions
- Advanced tracing of value flows into events
- Integration with analysis of external interface signatures
