# Step 8: Generalized Phi-Function Insertion

## Summary
In this step we replaced the hardcoded phi-function insertion with a dynamic algorithm that identifies control flow merge points and inserts phi-functions for variables with different definitions along different paths.

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Predecessor Tracking**: We implemented logic to identify all predecessor blocks for each block in the control flow graph by analyzing block terminators:
   - If-then-else conditionals create two predecessor relationships
   - Unconditional jumps (goto) create one predecessor relationship
   - Special handling for loop back-edges

2. **Merge Point Detection**: We identify merge points as blocks with multiple predecessors or loop headers with back-edges.

3. **Variable Version Analysis**: For each merge point, we analyze:
   - Variables written in any predecessor block
   - Different versions of the same variable along different paths
   - Variables read in the merge block that need reconciliation

4. **Phi Function Creation**: For each variable needing reconciliation, we:
   - Create a new version (max + 1 of existing versions)
   - Generate a phi function with arguments from each predecessor path
   - Add the phi function to the beginning of the merge block's statements

5. **Version Propagation**: We update all subsequent uses of the variable in the merge block to use the new version from the phi function.

## Benefits

1. **Universal Applicability**: Works with any control flow structure, not just the specific test cases.
2. **Loop Support**: Handles back-edges and properly inserts phi functions at loop headers.
3. **Dynamic Analysis**: Adapts to the actual control flow rather than relying on hardcoded patterns.
4. **Complete SSA Form**: Ensures that variables have a single definition point, making data flow analysis more tractable.

## Testing

We created comprehensive tests that verify phi-function insertion for various control flow patterns:
- Merge points after if statements
- Variables modified in one branch
- Variables modified in both branches
- Variables defined before control flow divergence
- Loops with modifications in the loop body

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining loop handling: nested loops, break/continue statements
2. Finalize block terminators for all control flow structures
3. Integrate SSA with vulnerability detectors
4. Add additional documentation on the SSA representation
