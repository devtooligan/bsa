# Step 12 - Fixed Block Splitting for Multi-Statement Functions

This step addresses a key issue with the block splitting in BSA: Previously, functions with multiple statements like assignments and function calls were grouped into a single block, leading to inaccurate block counts in the CLI output. The implemented changes ensure proper statement-level granularity for static analysis.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Enhanced the `split_into_basic_blocks` function to split on more statement types:

- **Previous Behavior**: Only control flow statements like `if`, `for`, `while`, and `return` caused block splits
- **New Behavior**: Function calls, assignments, and variable declarations also terminate blocks
- **Implementation**: Added an "additional_terminators" list that includes:
  - `"FunctionCall"` statements (e.g., `IA(a).hello()`)
  - `"Assignment"` statements (e.g., `x = 1`)
  - `"VariableDeclaration"` statements (e.g., `uint x = 1`)

### 2. Added a check to avoid unnecessary splits:
- Only terminates a block if the additional terminator is not the last statement in the function
- This prevents creating empty blocks that don't add value to the analysis

### 3. Added comprehensive tests to verify the implementation:
- Unit tests in `test_block_splitting.py` to verify basic block splitting behavior
- Integration tests in `test_block_splitting_integration.py` to ensure the changes work through the entire SSA pipeline
- Tested four key scenarios:
  1. Assignment, call, assignment (`x = 1; IA(a).hello(); y = 2;`)
  2. If statement with call in true branch, followed by assignment
  3. For loop with call in body
  4. Assignment followed by return

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Block Count**: The CLI now shows the correct number of blocks for functions with multiple statements
2. **Improved Analysis Granularity**: Each statement type that affects control flow or state gets its own block
3. **Better SSA Representation**: Function calls are properly isolated in their own blocks
4. **Enhanced Vulnerability Detection**: Detectors that rely on the block structure have more precise information

## Technical Details

The implementation preserves the original block terminator types for diagnostics, which helps in understanding the reason for each block split. The block splitting happens at the very beginning of the control flow graph construction, before any refinement or further analysis.

By ensuring that every significant statement gets its own block, we provide a more accurate representation of the control flow, which is crucial for static analysis tools. This is especially important for vulnerability detection, where the relationship between different operations needs to be clearly understood.

## Results

Before this change, a function like:
```solidity
function test() public {
    uint x = 1;
    IA(address(0)).hello();
    uint y = 2;
}
```

Would show as a single block in the CLI output, making it difficult to understand the actual flow and dependencies. After this change, such a function correctly shows as having 3 blocks, with proper terminators connecting them:

```
Block0: x = 1 → goto Block1
Block1: call[external](hello) → goto Block2
Block2: y = 2 → return
```

This more granular representation significantly improves BasedSSA's ability to perform precise static analysis.

## Next Steps

1. **Update Detectors**: Enhance vulnerability detectors to take advantage of the more precise block structure
2. **Improve Visualizations**: Add tools to visualize the control flow graph for easier debugging
3. **Performance Optimization**: Evaluate the performance impact of increased block counts
4. **Further Refinements**: Consider additional statement types that might benefit from block splitting
